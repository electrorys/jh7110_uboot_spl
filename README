*** DEPRECATED ***

This code was upstreamed into https://github.com/starfive-tech/Tools/, replacing proprietary one,
with more features added by StarFive developers, and now maintained there. This version will be archived.

DESCRIPTION

A replacement for VisionFive2 SDK spl_tool which happened to be proprietary.
Use only with VisionFive2 boards to make u-boot-spl.bin.normal.out image!

DISCLAIMER

Use at your own risk! I, Rys Andrey, don't bear any responsibility for
your broken hardware. Check the image carefully with your eyes before
flashing it to real device!

WHY

Cause I want it to run on RISC-V when building U-Boot there. I don't want
to resort to qemu-x86_64 to run a tool which does something very simple.

OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION

how to make bootable images for various boot sources (QSPI, eMMC, SD). It also covers this source aswell now.
